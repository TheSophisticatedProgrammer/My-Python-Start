#📘 Beginner Python Projects

This repository contains my early Python projects, created to build strong foundations in problem-solving, logical thinking, and mathematical reasoning.

**🎯 Goals of This Repository**

- Develop clear, structured thinking
- Strengthen understanding of functions and algorithms
- Improve ability to break down problems
- Build good coding habits early
- Create a visible record of learning progress

**🧠 Skills Being Developed**

- Algorithmic thinking
- Logical reasoning
- Function-based problem solving
- Debugging and error tracing

**Projects in this repository may include:**

- Function-based programs
- Number and pattern analysis
- Mathematical problem solvers
- Logic and decision-making programs
- Small experiments linking maths concepts to code
- Each project is kept simple, readable, and well-structured.

**📈 Progression Plan**

This repository will grow over time as I:
Improve problem-solving ability
Learn more advanced mathematical concepts
Move toward more complex algorithms and structures
The emphasis will remain on clarity, correctness, and understanding rather than speed or size.

These are learning-focused projects
Code may be revisited and improved later
Mistakes are part of the process
