for i in range(1, 101): 
    print(i)
    # for i - what i is, what will we make i do. in range - we will give i a range. (1, 101): - we choose the range of i.
    # observations: ranges are closed intervals.
    # what have I learnt: for - giving a variable something & in range - gives a variable a range.
